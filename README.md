# Clarification
Satellite’s cache will be updated only after the end of each message. This becomes evident from the example given in the pdf file - message 3: “found air and water near some creature”.
Here ‘some’ was added to satellite 3’s cache in message 2. 
If this was not the case, then ‘near’ would’ve replaced ‘some’ in the cache before we even encountered 'some'and we would’ve got a different response than 431 hours.

# Limitations
•	Some of the things I could think of, what this program cannot do as of now:
Handle complex sentences -> Hey! Hello, “Bye”.
Have to account for punctuation marks (if required). This can be added in future iterations.

•	Also, the code ‘might’ break for a few combinations of different memory sizes for satellites or if a lot of ‘potential’ cacheable words come up in a message. Just a heads up, this is just the first iteration of this tool.

# Although the entire human race depends on this program for fast data transfer between Curiosity 2 and NASA, coding it was ‘relatively’ easier than rescuing Matt Damon from Mars.
